# pybot

Wrapper for python-telegram-bot to allow dynamic plug-in architecture, an attempt to make python-telegram-bot more hubottish.

### Execution flow

1. `bin/pybot` starts the bot with the selected adapter and using the configuration options defined in `conf/pybot.conf` or the command-line arguments.

1. The selected adapter receives the message and sends it to the `brain.py`.

1. The `brain.py` loads in runtime all the `.py` files in the `./memory` folder each time and try to execute a defined method, for example `hear(message.text)`.

1. Each module in `./memory` with that method returns a response, the `brain.py` sends it to the `pybot.py` and it sends the response back to the chat.

* As the methods are dynamically loaded, you can edit and add the files in `./memory` without need to restart `pybot.py`, and they will be reloaded on the next message. Overkill but funny.
